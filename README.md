# web-components
Playing around with web components, Shadow DOM, new CSS features.

The goal is to build something that looks code-wise like a circa early 2000's website, highly declarative, with minimal / no libraries installed, no package manager, no compiler (other than for TS to JS), with complex behavior you would expect from a modern web application using lots of libraries and tools.
